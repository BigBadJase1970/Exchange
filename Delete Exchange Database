# This is because Arbitration mailboxes are created on the root domain by default.
# Now run:

Get-Mailbox -Arbitration | Ft Name, Database

# Now if you need to remove it and have another database available to home these, run the cmdlet:

Get-Mailbox -Arbitration | Set-Mailbox -Arbitration -Database “Name of the new Database”

# If you want to Move Arbitration to a new mailbox store and the old store is mounted and well,

Get-Mailbox -Arbitration -Database “CurrentDatabase” | New-MoveRequest -TargetDatabase “NewDatabaseName”

#Lets say the database contains mailboxes other than Arbitration and you want to move all of them to a new mailbox store and the old store is mounted and well,

Get-Mailbox -Database “CurrentDatabase” | New-MoveRequest -TargetDatabase “NewDatabaseName”

# If you want to Disable Arbitration mailboxes run:

Get-Mailbox -Arbitration -Database “CurrentDatabase” | Disable-Mailbox -Arbitration

# If you want to remove Arbitration mailboxes run:

Get-Mailbox -Arbitration -Database “CurrentDatabase” | Remove-Mailbox -Arbitration –RemoveLastArbitrationMailboxAllowed

# Now for some reason these Arbitration mailboxes went missing, then find the version of your exchange server using the cmdlet, then download the appropriate service pack and run setup /p

GCM exsetup |%{$_.Fileversioninfo}

# You may also replace the homeMDB value of the Arbitration mailbox with the DN of a mailbox database too.
